/*Given a positive integer n, find the sum of all integers in the range [1, n] inclusive that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7.
Return an integer denoting the sum of all numbers in the given range satisfying the constraint.
Input: n = 10
Output: 40
Explanation: Numbers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7 are 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10. 
The sum of these numbers is 40. */
